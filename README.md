### Comment Delegation Propagation Simulation

*This simulation developed for an academic paper which is in review*

In this simulation, we aimed to find out the best way to handle comments in a decentralized social network application while a user goes offline. During this offline time, the user gives delegation to a friend for handling comments below posts, and this delegation goes on until user come back or one of the previously delegated friends come back.
