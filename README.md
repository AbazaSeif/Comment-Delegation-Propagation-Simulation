### Comment Delegation Propagation Simulation

*This simulation developed for an academic paper which is in review*

In this simulation we aimed to find out best way to handle comments in a decentralized social network application while an user goes offline. During this offline time the user gives delegation to a friend for handling comments below posts and this delegation goes on until user come back or one of the previous delegated friend come back.
